### What I Learned

This project enhanced my front-end development skills by improving my understanding of HTML semantics and creative CSS styling techniques. I learned how to effectively integrate SVGs, adding a modern touch to the design. Additionally, I applied principles of visual hierarchy and accessibility to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

```html
<div class="card-details">
      <button>Learning</button>
      
      <p class="Date">Published 21 Dec 2023</p>
      
      <h3>HTML & CSS foundations</h3>
      
      <p class="card-Description">These languages are the backbone of every website, defining structure, content, and presentation.</p>

      <div class="person-info">
        
        <img src="./assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt=""><span>Greg Hooper</span>
        
      </div>
```
```css
body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    height: 130vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: var(--Yellow);
    box-sizing: border-box;
    font-family: "Figtree";
}

.container {
    background-color: var(--White);
    width: 375px;
    border-radius: 20px;
}
```


### Continued development

In the future I would like to 

- Learn react and other libraries
- How to apply 3D effects on websies
- work on some other projects to hone my web development skill

### Useful resources

- [mozilla.org] (https://www.mozilla.org) - Great resource for revisiting basic concepts and where you can visually see the effects of your css styles.

- [freecodecamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - helps to learn by actually engaging on projects apart from Frontend Mentor.
